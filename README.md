The course is practice-oriented, focusing on PostgreSQL, SQL queries, ER modeling, database design, transactions, indexing, and backup strategies.      

The goal of this repository is to:  
Document weekly lab assignments             
Provide code, queries, and database schemas     
Showcase the final project implementation
